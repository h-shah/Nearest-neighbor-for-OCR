# An assignment for my machine learning course
I had to implement the nearest neighbor in python, as well as use the k-means algorithm. I used the sklearn library for the k-means algorithm.

The image data we had to classify

## Nearest Neighbor.py
A basic nearest neighbor classification

A graph of the error rate based on how much training data was used for the above algorithm.

## Nearest Neighbor with kmeans.py
A more nuanced algorithm. We first use kmeans to cluster training points, reducing the number of neighbors we have to check.
